# Live Face Emotion Detection

This project implements a real-time face emotion detection system using **OpenCV**, **YOLO** for face detection, and a custom-trained **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for emotion classification.

---

## Overview

The emotion classification model is trained using a **two-stage transfer learning** approach:

1. **Initial training** on the **FER2013** dataset.  
2. **Fine-tuning** on the **IITM Face Emotion Dataset**, incorporating class weights to handle data imbalance and improve prediction normalization.

---

## Features

- **Face Detection:** Uses a pre-trained YOLO model (specifically a face-detection variant) to locate faces in a video stream.  
- **Emotion Classification:** Employs a CNN trained on facial expression datasets (FER2013 and IITM) to classify detected faces into distinct emotion categories.  
- **Transfer Learning:** Leverages knowledge from the larger FER2013 dataset before specializing on the smaller IITM dataset.  
- **Class Weighting:** Addresses potential bias towards common emotions (like *Happy* / *Smile*) during fine-tuning by applying class weights.  
- **Live Demo:** Provides a real-time demonstration using OpenCV to capture webcam feed, run detection/classification, and display results with emotion probabilities.  
- **TensorBoard Logging:** Training script includes TensorBoard integration for monitoring training progress.
